The Crypto upload App:
Introduction:
This app will be connected to our browser.
This app will allow users to host websites to the blockchain, and generate a website address without the need to buy or use any domain name like (.com, .net, or any other domain).

- We need a web app connected to this web browser.

- User will be able to access it after logged in.

- Then user will create new website.

- User will select the name of his website. (# method).

- The app will check the database of the names, if this name is used before or not.
(Database will be stored in the blockchain).

- When the name is approved, Then users will be able to upload website files to the blockchain by drag and drop the website files.

- Then the user will press upload button to host the website in the blockchain.

- When the website files are uploaded to the blockchain, Hash iD, or CID will be generated, (it's the long random digits iD, or the address of the uploaded files).

- The app will create a project iD, then link and lock this project iD to the CID.

- And then the app will connect this Project ID to the (# name).

- When that process is done correctly, the user will be able to access this website by only writing the (#) method (# + name). No need to use any domain name link (.com, .net, or any other domain).
